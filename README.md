# Hello it's Tam
# Hi tam, can you see this?
What happens if I don't put in hashtags? Nothing?
For this line, I left a description below
ohhh I can see yours now
okay so do we copy and paste our code here and it pastes line by line or something?
I guess you can go in and edit the code so we have the same thing
Like if I paste my code and its wrong, you can just fix it?
I guess?
